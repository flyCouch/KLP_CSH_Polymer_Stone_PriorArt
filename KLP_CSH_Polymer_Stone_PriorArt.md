## Abstract

A novel, low-carbon binder formulation and manufacturing process is described for producing a highly durable Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Polymer Stone. The method, termed **Kinetic Lock Polymerization (KLP)**, relies on chemically locking the highly reactive binder in an inert, sub-freezing state.

The two-part system uses a supercooled **Sodium Silicate (Na2SiO3) slurry** as the primary binder and **Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2)** as the activator. The mixture is triggered to cure instantaneously upon reaching ambient temperature, eliminating the need for high-energy calcination. The cured material achieves a predicted 28-day ultimate hardness of **6.5 to 7.5 Mohs**, offering superior durability and a zero-VOC construction alternative.

## 1. Technical Field

The invention relates to ambient-temperature materials synthesis, sustainable construction, low-carbon inorganic polymer binders, and chemically-controlled reaction kinetics for high-performance composites.

## 2. Detailed Description of the KLP Process

The KLP process leverages the principle that reaction kinetics are severely inhibited at low temperatures, enabling the safe storage and application of a highly reactive binder.

### 2.1 Part A: The Binder Slurry (Na2SiO3 Phase)

The binder is an aqueous solution of **Sodium Silicate (Na2SiO3)**.

* **Sucrose:** Used as a reaction retarder to control set time for manual casting, typically at **0.5% to 1.0% by mass** of the binder.
* **Cryogenic Storage:** The solution is chilled to a temperature of approximately **-2.3 deg C (270.85 K)**. At this temperature, the material achieves a **supercooled, viscous slurry state**, which chemically locks the reaction kinetics.

### 2.2 Part B: The Activator Powder (Ca(OH)2 Phase)

The dry solid phase is composed of **Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2)** (the calcium ion source) and any necessary aggregate (e.g., sand).

### 2.3 Curing Mechanism

1.  **Triggering:** The supercooled Binder Slurry is rapidly introduced to the Activator Powder under ambient conditions.
2.  **Cure:** Thermal transfer causes the binder slurry to immediately melt. This triggers the polymerization reaction, forming the rigid C-S-H gel.
3.  **Reaction (Simplified):** Soluble Silicates + Calcium Ions + Water + Heat $\rightarrow$ C-S-H Polymer Gel
4.  **Set Time:** The set time is controllable between **10 to 20 minutes** with sucrose retardation.

## 3. Material Properties and Applications

* **Ultimate Hardness:** Predicted 28-day ultimate hardness of **6.5 to 7.5 Mohs** (comparable to natural quartz).
* **Chemical Robustness:** The process is highly tolerant of minor mixing imperfections, confirming its suitability for low-cost, high-volume production.
* **Sustainability:** The final product is **low-carbon**, **non-toxic**, and **zero-VOC**.
* **Applications:** Structural components, high-abrasion pavers, zero-VOC flooring, and neutron radiation shielding.
