Recipe for business card type samples.

All room temperatures.

8.6g of lime powder.
In a different container, 25g of sodium silicate solution.
Only immediately prior to full mixing, add
.2-5ml of .05% sugar solution + food colouring.
The more liquid water, the longer it takes for intial soft gel set.
Mix the solution and the water based things carefully but not too much,
You are aiming for dispersal of the water but not enough time to dissolve (much) within the sodium silicate solution,
And then add quickly, the lime.
Mix vigorous with a grinding against the sides motion.
Until uniform, and smooth, don't try too hard here,
as crystals are starting to form.
The water goes to the lime first then the wetted lime goes to the sodium silicate molecules.
After mixing, drop tap it to get rid of air bubbles.
There is a timing game to master.
Keep away from CO2, while setting.
Like concrete, for 28 days.
