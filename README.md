Novel Low-Carbon, Ambient-Cure C-S-H Polymer Stone via Kinetic Lock Polymerization (KLP)

A full public disclosure of a novel, low-carbon binder formulation and manufacturing process for a high-performance Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Polymer Stone.

Key Features

Low-Carbon: Eliminates the need for high-energy clinker calcination.

Ambient-Cure: Cures rapidly at room temperature.

High Performance: Achieves a predicted 28-day ultimate hardness of 6.5 to 7.5 Mohs, comparable to natural quartz.

Zero-VOC: Non-toxic and safe alternative to traditional binders.

KLP Process: Uses a unique Kinetic Lock Polymerization principle by exploiting the supercooled state of the reactive binder.

The Kinetic Lock Polymerization (KLP) Method

The KLP process involves chemically locking a highly reactive Sodium Silicate binder in a dormant state until it is thermally triggered.

Part A: The Binder Slurry (Sodium Silicate - Na2SiO3)

The binder is an aqueous solution of Sodium Silicate (Na2SiO3), which contains the essential silicon ions.

The solution includes a small amount of Sucrose (typically 0.5% to 1.0% by mass) to act as a reaction retarder and control the final set time.

The sugar also acts as dispersant.

Cryogenic Storage: The solution is supercooled to approximately -2.3 deg C (270.85 K), achieving a viscous, semi-frozen slurry state that "kinetically locks" the polymerization reaction.

Part B: The Activator Powder (Calcium Hydroxide - Ca(OH)2)

The dry powder phase supplies the necessary calcium ions to trigger the C-S-H reaction.

Primary components include Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) mixed with any desired aggregate (e.g., sand, stone dust).

Curing Process (Thermal Trigger)

The cure is initiated instantaneously upon contact between the supercooled slurry (Part A) and the ambient-temperature powder (Part B).

Step 1: Mixing. The rapid mixing causes thermal transfer.

Step 2: Unlocking. The binder slurry immediately melts and warms up.

Step 3: Reaction. The rise in temperature and the presence of calcium ions trigger rapid polymerization, forming the rigid C-S-H gel.

Step 4: Reaction (Simplified): Soluble Silicates + Calcium Ions + Water + Heat -> C-S-H Polymer Gel

Applications

The resulting C-S-H Polymer Stone is suitable for:

Structural components.

High-abrasion pavers and tiles.

Zero-VOC flooring and finishes.

Specialized materials (e.g., radiation shielding).

It also works at room temperature if you are quick.

Also, I have found that adding liquids such as the sugar solution or food colouring or new water (a small amount) makes a difference.

The fresh liquid helps disperses the lime.

The fresh liquid temporaily blocks the receptors on the sodium silicate for a few moments.

The more liquid, the more moments of blockage. There is a limit though.

Also, mixing times are important.

Water Affinity Competition: 

Lime and Sodium SilicateWhen a small amount of water is introduced to a quick mixture of lime powder and sodium silicate solution, the water will overwhelmingly prefer to interact with the lime powder.

This scenario is governed by competitive reaction kinetics and the fundamental chemical properties of the materials involved.

1. The Immediate Winner: Lime Powder (Calcium Oxide - CaO)The water's strongest chemical affinity is for the lime powder, specifically if the powder is Quicklime (Calcium Oxide, CaO).Process: Hydration (Chemical Reaction)Lime undergoes a rapid, highly exothermic chemical reaction called hydration:CaO + H2O -> Ca(OH)2 + HeatMechanism: This reaction is aggressive and instantaneous.
2. Calcium Oxide has a powerful drive to form Calcium Hydroxide (slaked lime) and will aggressively capture any free water molecules in the mixture.Driving Force: This is a strong chemical reaction that generates significant heat and consumes the water, effectively "stealing" it from the rest of the system.2.
3.
4. The Loser: Sodium Silicate Solution (Physical Dilution)The sodium silicate solution is already a mixture of silica and water.Process: Dilution (Physical Process)When water encounters the sodium silicate solution, it only causes dilution, not a strong chemical reaction.
5.
6. Mechanism: Water molecules simply mix with the water molecules already in the solution.
7.
8. The energy release and driving force for dilution are minimal compared to the hydration of lime.
9.
10. Conclusion: Since the lime's hydration is a strong, rapid chemical reaction while the silicate's interaction is merely passive physical mixing, the lime consumes the available water first.NOTE: The eventual setting reaction (forming Calcium Silicate Hydrate) occurs only after the lime has successfully hydrated and the resulting calcium ions are available to slowly react with the silicate ions.
