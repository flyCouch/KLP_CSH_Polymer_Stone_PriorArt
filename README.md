Novel Low-Carbon, Ambient-Cure C-S-H Polymer Stone via Kinetic Lock Polymerization (KLP)

A full public disclosure of a novel, low-carbon binder formulation and manufacturing process for a high-performance Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) Polymer Stone.

Key Features

Low-Carbon: Eliminates the need for high-energy clinker calcination.

Ambient-Cure: Cures rapidly at room temperature.

High Performance: Achieves a predicted 28-day ultimate hardness of 6.5 to 7.5 Mohs, comparable to natural quartz.

Zero-VOC: Non-toxic and safe alternative to traditional binders.

KLP Process: Uses a unique Kinetic Lock Polymerization principle by exploiting the supercooled state of the reactive binder.

The Kinetic Lock Polymerization (KLP) Method

The KLP process involves chemically locking a highly reactive Sodium Silicate binder in a dormant state until it is thermally triggered.

Part A: The Binder Slurry (Sodium Silicate - Na2SiO3)

The binder is an aqueous solution of Sodium Silicate (Na2SiO3), which contains the essential silicon ions.

The solution includes a small amount of Sucrose (typically 0.5% to 1.0% by mass) to act as a reaction retarder and control the final set time.

The sugar also acts as dispersant.

Cryogenic Storage: The solution is supercooled to approximately -2.3 deg C (270.85 K), achieving a viscous, semi-frozen slurry state that "kinetically locks" the polymerization reaction.

Part B: The Activator Powder (Calcium Hydroxide - Ca(OH)2)

The dry powder phase supplies the necessary calcium ions to trigger the C-S-H reaction.

Primary components include Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) mixed with any desired aggregate (e.g., sand, stone dust).

Curing Process (Thermal Trigger)

The cure is initiated instantaneously upon contact between the supercooled slurry (Part A) and the ambient-temperature powder (Part B).

Step 1: Mixing. The rapid mixing causes thermal transfer.

Step 2: Unlocking. The binder slurry immediately melts and warms up.

Step 3: Reaction. The rise in temperature and the presence of calcium ions trigger rapid polymerization, forming the rigid C-S-H gel.

Step 4: Reaction (Simplified): Soluble Silicates + Calcium Ions + Water + Heat -> C-S-H Polymer Gel

Applications

The resulting C-S-H Polymer Stone is suitable for:

Structural components.

High-abrasion pavers and tiles.

Zero-VOC flooring and finishes.

Specialized materials (e.g., radiation shielding).
